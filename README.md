This is a Mortgage calculator built with React JS, the idea was to create a project where the user can access a calculator and check how much it would cost per month a house mortgage.

To use the App, starting on the home page, scroll to the button of the page and click Start mortgage calculator. On the calculator page please enter numbers larger than 0 into Price of the property, deposit, length of term in years, and interest rate. After adding the values, please click calculate to see the results. In case you want to do another calculator, please click clear and the form will be read for the next role.
